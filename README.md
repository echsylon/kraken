This 3d party library aims to wrap the official [Kraken Exchange API](https://www.kraken.com/help/api) and offer convenient means of asynchronously querying it in a way that's suitable on the Android platform.

Feel free to [raise a ticket](https://github.com/echsylon/kraken/issues) if you find a bug, would like something to change (actually I'd consider buying you a beer if you submit a pull request with a suggested change), or just want to discuss a topic.
